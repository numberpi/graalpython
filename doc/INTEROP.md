## Interop

#### Interop from Python

You can import the `polyglot` module to interact with other languages.

```python
import polyglot
```

You can import a global value from the entire polyglot scope:
```python
imported_polyglot_global = polyglot.import_value("global_name")
```
This global should then work as expected, accessing items sends `READ` messages,
calling methods sends `INVOKE` messages etc.

You can evaluate some code in another language:
```python
polyglot.eval(string="1 + 1", language="ruby")
```

This kind of `polyglot.eval` also works with the somewhat obscure mime-types:
```python
polyglot.eval(string="1 + 1", language="application/x-ruby")
```

It also works with the path to a file:
```python
polyglot.eval(file="./my_ruby_file.rb", language="ruby")
```

If you pass a file, you can also try to rely on the file-based language detection:
```python
polyglot.eval(file="./my_ruby_file.rb")
```

To export something from Python to other Polyglot languages so they can import
it:
```python
foo = object() polyglot.export_value(foo, "python_foo")
```

The export function can be used as a decorator, in this case the function name
is used as the globally exported name:
```python
@polyglot.export_value
def python_method():
    return "Hello from Python!"
```

Finally, to interoperate with Java (only when running on the JVM), you can use
the `java` module:
```python
import java
BigInteger = java.type("java.math.BigInteger")
myBigInt = BigInteger(42)
myBigInt.shiftLeft(128)            # public Java methods can just be called
myBigInt["not"]()                  # Java method names that are keywords in
                                   # Python can be accessed using "[]"
byteArray = myBigInt.toByteArray()
print(list(byteArray))             # Java arrays can act like Python lists
```

In addition to the `type` builtin method, the `java` module, exposes the following 
methods as well:

Builtin | Specification
--- | ---
`instanceof(obj, class)` | returns `True` if `obj` is an instance of `class` (`class` must be a foreign object class)
`is_function(obj)` | returns `True` if `obj` is a Java host language function wrapped using Truffle interop
`is_object(obj)` | returns `True` if `obj` if the argument is Java host language object wrapped using Truffle interop
`is_symbol(obj)` | returns `True` if `obj` if the argument is a Java host symbol, representing the constructor and static members of a Java class, as obtained by `java.type`

```python
import java
ArrayList = java.type('java.util.ArrayList')
my_list = ArrayList()
print(java.is_symbol(ArrayList))    # prints True
print(java.is_symbol(my_list))      # prints False, my_list is not a Java host symbol
print(java.is_object(ArrayList))    # prints True, symbols are also host objects 
print(java.is_function(my_list.add))# prints True, the add method of ArrayList
print(java.instanceof(my_list, ArrayList)) # prints True 
```    


#### Python responses to Truffle interop messages

###### READ
If the key is a String try using `__getattribute__` to read. If that fails or
the key isn't a String, but there is both a `__len__` and a `__getitem__`
method, call `__getitem__`.

Since the `KEYS` message returns an object's attributes, `READ` thus prefers the
object attributes if the key is a String, and only falls back to `__getitem__`
if the key is not a String or the object actually looks like a sequence.

Since disambiguation is hard here, to be explicit when using String keys, the
key may be prefixed with `@` to force `__getattribute__` access or with `[` to
force `__getitem__` access. If an item is accessed that starts with `@`, this
will mean we first try to read it as an attribute without the `@`, only to fall
back to reading it as an item. If the performance of this access is an issue,
always prefixing may be advisable.

###### UNBOX
* `str` => `java.lang.String`
* `byte` => `java.lang.String`, assuming Java system encoding
* `float` => `double`
* `int` => `int` or `long`, if it fits, otherwise raises an interop exception

###### WRITE
If the key is an attribute defined directly on the object (not inherited), use
`__setattr__`. If the key is a String and there is a `keys`, `items`, `values`
and a `__setitem__` method, we assume this is a Mapping and try to set the key
using `__setitem__`. If the key is a String, but not all of `keys`, `items`, and
`values` exists, we use `__setattr__`. Otherwise, we try to use `__setitem__` if
that exists, or otherwise fall back to `__setattr__`.

Just as with `READ`, disambiguation is hard here, so to be explicit when using
String keys, the key may be prefixed with `@` to force `__setattr__` access or
with `[` to force `__setitem__` access.

###### REMOVE
The remove message follows the same logic as the `WRITE` message, except with
`__delattr__` and `__delitem__`. It returns true if the removal was successful.

###### EXECUTE
Call the `__call__` method of the receiver with the provided arguments.

###### IS_EXECUTABLE
Returns true if the receiver has inherited a `__call__` field.

###### IS_INSTANTIABLE
Returns true only for python classes, i.e., type instances constructed through
the `type` constructor.

###### INVOKE
The equivalent of `receiver.methodname(arguments)`.

###### NEW
Calls the constructor only if the receiver object is a Python class.

###### IS_NULL
Returns true for None only.

###### HAS_SIZE
According to the Truffle interop contract answering `true` to `HAS_SIZE` implies
that indexed element access is available. However, we cannot fully guarantee
this. We may answer `true` here when the object has both a `__len__` field and a
`__getitem__` field. If the object's length is reported >0, we also try to read
the item `0` and if that fails, we answer `false`. If the object reports it's
empty, we cannot know if a read with an index will actually work, but we'll
report `true`.

###### GET_SIZE
Calls `__len__`. Just because `GET_SIZE` returns something positive does not
mean that accessing the object using integers is possible. We have no way of
knowing what the `__getitem__` method does with an integer argument. Use
`HAS_SIZE` first for a more conservative check if indexed access is possible.

###### IS_BOXED
Returns true for those values that can be unboxed using the `UNBOX` message.

###### KEY_INFO
This will lookup the key using the Python MRO. It will check if it's readable
and writable, and also check if it has side-effects based on wether it is an
inherited descriptor (i.e., an object with `__get__`, `__set__`, and/or
`__delete__`). If the owner of the key is mutable (the owner being the class the
key is inherited from or the object itself) then `REMOVABLE` and `MODIFABLE` are
true. If the object itself is mutable, `INSERTABLE` will also be true. Finally,
if the attribute is a function or it is *not* a descriptor and has a `__call__`,
we declare it `INOCABLE`. We don't do this for descriptors, because we would
have to run the `__get__` method and this message should not have side-effects.

###### HAS_KEYS
Always returns true.

###### KEYS
This returns the all attributes of the receiver object that would usually be
available through `__getattribute__`, i.e., both inherited and direct
attributes.

If the object responds to `keys`, `values`, `items`, and `__getitem__`, we
assume it is Mapping, and we present the String result of the `keys` method in
combination with the attributes, prefixed with `[` if, and only if, the request
asked for _internal_ keys also. The `KEYS` message requires the returned object
to have only `java.lang.String` items, so inlo String keys are added to the
result set. The `[` prefix ensures that in our handling of `READ` and `WRITE`
messages we also treat them as mapping entries, not attributes.

It's still possible that none of the keys can be `READ`: the `READ` message uses
Python semantics for lookup, which means that an inherited descriptor with a
`__get__` method or the `__getitem__` method may still intercept actual access.

###### IS_POINTER
Returns true if the object is a Python function defined in a Python C extension
module and the function pointer is a native pointer.

###### AS_POINTER
Returns the underlying C function pointer for the Python C extension module.

###### TO_NATIVE
Returns the underlying TruffleObject for a Python C extension module function
if that is a native pointer.
